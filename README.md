# GIAN
GIAN - translates to 'knowledge' in Hindi/Sanskrit (Placing an 'I' instead of a 'Y' was intentional ! ).
The purpose of this repo is to organise all my learnings whether daiLy or weekly or monthly.
I will be documenting my learnings in CS topics like Data Structures , Algorthims & Frontend  or Backend Web development.
