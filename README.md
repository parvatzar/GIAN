# GIAN
GIAN - translates to 'knowledge' in Hindi/Sanskrit (Placing an 'I' instead of a 'Y' was intentional ! ).
The purpose of this repository is to organize all my learnings whether daily or weekly or monthly.
I will be documenting my learnings in CS topics like Data Structures , Algorithms & Front end  or 
Back end Web development.
